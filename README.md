# Edomi baseimages
With this project you can create baseimages for [Edomi](http://edomi.de/),
which are based on [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/de/), the successor
of CentOS.

## Build baseimages
Please use helper script `buildImages.sh` as there are some special tweaks required... ;-)

The Image [starwarsfan/edomi-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/starwarsfan/edomi-docker/) from this
[Github project](https://github.com/starwarsfan/edomi-docker) is using the baseimages created here.
